## Overview

This project is a **Product View Page** built with:
- **NuxtJS** for server-side rendering and dynamic routing.
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling.
- **Element Plus** for prebuilt, customizable UI components.
- **Storybook** for component documentation and development.
- **Atomic Design** to create a modular and scalable component architecture.

The application features a dynamic product listing with interactive filters, detailed product view, and responsive layouts.

## Features

- **Product Listing**: Displays a list of products.
- **Product Details**: Each product has a dedicated details page with images, descriptions.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Reusability**: Components are built using atomic design principles for modularity.

## Component Architecture

This project uses **Atomic Design** for structuring components:

- **Atoms**: Basic UI elements (e.g., `Button.vue`, `Text.vue`).
- **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms that perform a specific function (e.g., `ProductCard.vue`).
- **Organisms**: Larger UI sections formed by molecules and atoms (e.g., `ProductList.vue`).


## UI Design

- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive, utility-first styling.
- **Element Plus**: To leverage prebuilt components like dropdowns, sliders, and modals.

## Usage in Application

Components are reusable and can be integrated seamlessly into pages.
